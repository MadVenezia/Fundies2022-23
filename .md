Hi hun,

I miss you so much, even though it's only been a week (not even). I'm incredibly grateful for everything this past month. Every day with you, even when we're apart, has been a joy. Talking with you at the end of each day truly makes even the worst days a little better. I know this week has been tough for you, so I hope I could help, even if just a little bit.

I'm seriously so proud of you for just pushing on. You're a better person than me in that way.

I really don't have a specific purpose for writing this, I just wanted to. I know things are getting a little crazy again, but I'm so excited to spend next week and the rest of the summer with you. Also, in the winter, we should go sledding together and make hot cocoa by a fire. I guess no matter the season, I'm just excited to hang out with you.

I know I've had my moments recently; it's been hard to transition out of school. But I appreciate your patience. And I'm feeling a lot better now (those sunny walks and rotting in bed do wonders). So, don't worry about me too much; I'm taking care of myself, promise (though I could always use more hydration).

I wish you were down here with me; it's genuinely so beautiful and relaxing. I want to show you everything. I also wish I was there with you to scratch your head and give you the big hugs you more than deserve.

I'm so, so happy with this relationship and that you've let me into your life. Meeting your school friends and family (especially Cole) is such an honor. I can't wait until you visit me so we can meet some of my people (or just be big and greedy at Hibachi). I also can not wait for the next time I get to make you moan üòâ.

I Love You and Thank You üíù
