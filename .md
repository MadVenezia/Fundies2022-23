Hi hun, I miss you so much (it has only been a week, not even). I am so greatful for everything this last month, I have enjoyed every day with you. Even if we were not together. 
Talking with you at the end of the day makes even the worst day a little better. I know this week has been sucky for you so I hope I could help you, even a little with all of it. 
I am seriously so proud of you for just pushing on, you're a better person than me in that way.

I really have no purpose in writing this, I just wanted to and it was on my list of things to do now that semester is over. 
I know things are getting a little crazy again but im so excited to spend next week, and the rest of the summer, with you. Also we should go sledding together and make hot coco with a fire.
I guess no matter the season i am just excited to hangout with you. 

I know I have had my moments recently, it has been hard to transition out of school. But I apprecite your patience. And I am feeling a lot better (the sunny walks and rotting in bed do wonders for my soul ;) 
so dont have to worry about me too much I am taking care of myself (could use more hydration though).

I wish you were down here with me it is genuinely so beatiful and relaxing, I also wish I was there with you to scratch your head and give the big hugs you more then deserve.

I am so so happy with this relationship, and that you let me into your life, meeting your school friends, and family (especially cole) is such an honor.
I cant wait till you visit me so we can meet some of my people (or just be big and greedy at hibachi).

I Love You and Thank You üíù
